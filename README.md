To run this you will need typescript compiler and npm/node installed and setup.
Here some commands you can use to run the app,
* `npm run devstart`: Build the project's assets (front-end), starts running sails and open a new window with ng server watching code for updates in real time.
* `npm start`: Builds production version.
